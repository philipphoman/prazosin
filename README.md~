## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to run the analyses locally on your machine, you will need a
bunch of software packages installed:

* SAS University Edition (free; see
  https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html)
